  summary: Start a SLAC analysis
  description: |
    SLAC (Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting) uses a maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstruction
    and minimum path substitution counting to estimate site-level dS and dN, and applies a simple
    binomial-based test to test if dS differs from dN. The estimates aggregate information over all branches,
    so the signal is derived from pervasive diversification or conservation.
