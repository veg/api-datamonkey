  summary: Start a FADE job
  description: >
    Start a FADE (FUBAR Approach to Directional Evolution) job. FADE is a fast method to test 
    whether or not a subset of sites in a protein alignment evolve towards a particular residue 
    along a subset of branches at accelerated rates compared to reference model. FADE uses a 
    random effects model and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) - inspired approximation methods 
    to allocate sites to rate classes.
