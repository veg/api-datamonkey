  summary: Start a CONTRAST-FEL analysis
  description: |
    Starts a Contrast-FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood with Contrast) job to investigate whether selective pressures differ 
    between two or more sets of branches at a site. The method estimates site-specific synonymous (alpha) and 
    non-synonymous (beta, one per branch set) substitution rates and tests beta rates for equality at each site.
